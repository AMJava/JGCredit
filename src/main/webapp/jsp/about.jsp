          <h2>A leading global financial company</h2>
          <p>Our strategy builds on JGCredit core strengths: its position as a leading global wealth manager, its specialist investment banking capabilities and its strong presence in our home market of the Baltic states. We take a balanced approach to capture the wealth management opportunities in emerging markets, the largest of which is in the Baltic region, while also serving key developed markets with an emphasis on Latvia.<br>Founded in 2016, we today have a global reach with operations in over 10 countries and 100 employees from over 20 different nations. Our broad footprint helps us to generate a geographically balanced stream of revenues and net new assets and allows us to capture growth opportunities around the world.</p>
